### **Project Idea 1: GFW Simulation and Attack Analysis**

We plan to study the technical mechanisms behind the Great Firewall of China, focusing on how it identifies and blocks access to foreign websites. Our goal is to simulate a simplified version of the GFW within a controlled environment, reproducing basic filtering behaviors such as blocking access to selected domains or specific website fields. Based on this model, we aim to design a simple attack or bypass tool to evaluate the weaknesses of such firewalls, and suggest possible improvements.

### **Project Idea 2: DNS-based Phishing Detection and Honeypot Monitoring**

We came up with this idea to explores the detection of phishing and malicious activity using DNS behavior analysis and honeypot monitoring. First, we plan to deploy a low-interaction honeypot to collect attackers information such as source IP addresses, user agents, and DNS queries. Second, we will analyze DNS patterns typically associated with phishing domains and implement a lightweight DNS monitoring module to passively or actively identify suspicious activity. Our ultimate goal is to prototype a small-scale defensive system that combines honeypot logging and DNS-based detection to flag phishing attempts in a network environment(maybe we can pack it up to a simple script to be installed on our browser?).

### **Project Idea 3: WPA3 Wi-Fi Attack Simulation and Defense Evaluation**

We will investigate the security of WPA3-encrypted wireless networks. We aim to set up a test Wi-Fi environment using WPA3 and simulate specific attacks like potential man-in-the-middle. We will evaluate how the WPA3 protocol behaves under forced disconnection, and whether clients are vulnerable or recover securely. We will then assess the effectiveness of wireless intrusion detection/prevention systems (WIDS/WIPS) in this environment, and whether WPA3â€™s new features require updated detection rules or configurations. The goal is to understand how WPA3 networks withstand modern wireless attacks and how defensive systems can adapt accordingly.
